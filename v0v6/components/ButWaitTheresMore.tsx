          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Discover Your Unique Learner Type—and Unlock Your Full Potential</h3>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
            <p className="font-bold">Here&apos;s the truth:</p>
            <p>Most students are stuck in a cycle of frustration because they&apos;re using study methods that don&apos;t align with their Learner Type.</p>
            <p>You&apos;ve probably tried copying what top students do—only to find it doesn&apos;t work for you. Or maybe you&apos;ve heard stories of students who barely study but still ace their exams.</p>

            <p className="font-bold">What&apos;s their secret?</p>
            <p>It&apos;s not just raw talent or intelligence. It&apos;s about understanding their Learner Type—and using it to their advantage.</p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What&apos;s a Learner Type?</h4>
            <p>Your Learner Type is based on five core dimensions that determine how efficiently you learn:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Deep Processing:</strong> Your ability to think critically, make connections, and understand complex ideas.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-Regulation:</strong> Your ability to monitor and adapt your learning methods to achieve your goals.</li>
              <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> Your resilience and willingness to learn from mistakes.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-Management:</strong> Your ability to organize, plan, and stay consistent.</li>
              <li><strong>Retrieval Practice:</strong> How effectively you retain and recall information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These dimensions combine to create your unique Learner Type—and once you know yours, you can stop wasting time on methods that don&apos;t work for you.</p>

            <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters:</h4>
            <p>Most students fall into one of four Learner Types:</p>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <li>The community is on a new platform. We&apos;ve NEVER tested it before. YOU are the guinea pig.</li>
            <li>There&apos;s NOTHING happening inside except for a library of content and a couple of weekly calls with this guy named Awab. Bummer right? And also, a couple of exercises. So what...?</li>
            <li>It&apos;s $47 PER month. Not a one off. $47. Every-single-month. Can you imagine?</li>
            <li>There are only 10 spots. You&apos;re probably not even gonna be able to get in on time.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 mb-8">This Is NOT A Good Fit For:</h2>
          <ul className="list-none space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">

            <li>❌ For those looking for a magic bullet.</li>
            <li>❌ For anyone who expects to learn everything in 3 days and leave. <strong>This is a process. And it will take me time to transfer the information from my head to yours.</strong></li>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>I&apos;m over-delivering by a ton</strong> with the free course AND the information that&apos;s ALREADY inside the community. Not to mention the live calls and everything else...</p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">But it MIGHT seem like the community is still underdeveloped. And you wouldn&apos;t be wrong.</p>
