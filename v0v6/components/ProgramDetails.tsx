           Even with all this, people wanted more. And I wanted to give more. I love sharing and teaching (my dad is a teacher—can you blame me?).

            And I want to catch you up to speed on this BEFORE you join. Let me explain.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            You see... Many students think getting a tutor is the key to better grades. But is it really?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Here&apos;s how tutoring typically works:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 text-lg mb-6">
            <li>They give you more resources</li>
            <li>They give you guidance and instruction</li>
            <li>Your knowledge increases</li>
            <li>Your exam results go up</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Sounds great, right? But there&apos;s a problem.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Ask yourself: What happens if you stop getting tutoring? Your access to resources and guidance disappears. Your knowledge and ability to apply it decreases too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            This means tutoring hasn&apos;t changed your state. You&apos;re like a level 1 character in a game, wearing level 6 armor and weapons. Take away the armor and weapons, and you&apos;re back to level 1.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            As your classes get harder and your goals get higher, you&apos;ll need more and more tutoring. Eventually, it won&apos;t be enough. You&apos;ll hit a wall because you haven&apos;t fundamentally changed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            And then coming to my DMs and complaining about not being able to get the grades they used to get...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            And I get it. It stinks. And is super demotivating. I&apos;ve been there... And that&apos;s why when you join the Nord Community today
          </p>
