        <p className="font-bold mb-4">Helped 15,000+ people improve their results and reduce their study time</p>
        <p>Here&apos;s his story as he tells it:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 mt-2 italic whitespace-pre-line">
          {`I remembered walking out of a lecture after week 1 telling myself, "There is no way I can keep up anymore…"...

          I knew `}<em>I needed a better approach</em>{` if I wanted to do well without repeating last year's struggles.

          Over the next few years, I dove into thousands of research papers on learning, constantly building on the techniques I'd picked up from medicine.

          Eventually, I was confident enough to teach what I had refined to the students I tutored, and it worked!

          This obsession led me back to university, where I completed a Master's in Education `}<strong>scoring the highest grade in every paper</strong>{` and was awarded the Dean's award for the top graduating student in the program.

          `}<em>And I only studied a few hours a day for 6 weeks…</em>{`

          I discovered that many students, like myself, were stuck in a cycle of intense work, inconsistent results, and anxiety. 

          `}<strong>The methods we were using were inefficient and unsustainable.</strong>{` 

          Recognizing this, I left my medical career to teach these effective learning skills full-time.`}

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Here&apos;s the Truth: I&apos;m Not an Expert—I&apos;m a Curator of Expertise.</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            I&apos;ve spent <strong>5 years</strong> diving deep into the science of learning. I&apos;ve read every book, taken every course, and tested every technique—from Josh Waitzkin&apos;s <em>The Art of Learning</em> to Justin Sung&apos;s <em>icanStudy</em> system. I&apos;ve even implemented Scott H. Young&apos;s <em>Ultralearning</em> principles in my own life.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            But here&apos;s the problem: <strong>Most students don&apos;t have 5 years to waste figuring this out.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">What Happens When You Spend 15 minutes a day Using Science to Improve Your Brain?</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Neuroplasticity is real - that is, the brain can change, learn and improve based on experience. Most students ignore this huge potential. Their approach to studying often stays the same from middle school to college. While they might incorporate more online tools or get better at researching online, they rarely build foundational study skills that allow them to learn <strong>Faster</strong>. This stagnant mindset wastes time and creates unnecessary work.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black-700">
            What should we do?
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Adopt the mindset of athletes. Athletes practice daily to improve their core skills and refine their techniques through consistent practice. Students should take a similar approach, dedicating time every day to sharpen their study skills and build the habits that lead to faster and more effective learning.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          We should use proven, science-backed techniques to <strong>train our brains to learn faster</strong>, remember more, and recall easily.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-black-700">
          Imagine spending only 15 minutes a day:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Saving information in long-term memory</strong> with spaced repetition and retrieval practice.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving focus and getting more done</strong> by managing mental effort and avoiding distractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding hard ideas</strong> with better notetaking and mind-mapping methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Feeling less stress and more confident</strong> by believing in your ability to learn and succeed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            These small daily habits add up, changing how you learn and perform. The best part? You don’t need to study for hours to see progress.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
           That’s why I created the <strong>Nord Program</strong>—to give you the tools, methods, and support to unlock your brain’s full potential. It’s not about working harder; it’s about working smarter.
